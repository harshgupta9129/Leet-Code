// To find the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number n (that is, n!), we need to understand how a trailing zero is formed.
// A trailing zero is added every time a number is multiplied by 10.
// And since 10 = 2 Ã— 5, we need both a 2 and a 5 to make one trailing zero.
// In n! (1 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 Ã— ... Ã— n), we get plenty of 2s because every second number is even.
// But 5s are less frequent, so they are the limiting factor.
// That means:
// ðŸ‘‰ The number of trailing zeroes is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in all numbers from 1 to n.
